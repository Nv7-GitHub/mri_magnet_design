# MRI4ALL Open-Source Tools for Design of the Hallbach-Array Magnet

Please watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKs5pwwoyoQ" target="_blank">video below</a> for an introduction to the tools provided in this repository.

[![Overview of the MRI4ALL Magnet Tools](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iKs5pwwoyoQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKs5pwwoyoQ)

## Setup

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The scripts use magpylib 4 units (mm, mT, kA/m); magpylib 5 switched to SI and will silently give wrong fields, so it is pinned in `requirements.txt`.

## Demagnetization check (required iHc)

`check_demag.py` computes the reverse H field every magnet in a ledger sees (from all other magnets plus its own self-demagnetization) and the minimum intrinsic coercivity iHc the magnets need:

```bash
python check_demag.py my_design.xlsx --max-temp 40 --safety 1.2 --plot
```

- `--max-temp`: hottest the magnets will ever get, including assembly and epoxy curing. iHc is derated at -0.6 %/°C (CY-Mag datasheet in `magnet_properties/`).
- `--Br`: remanence in mT (default 1270, as in the optimization scripts).
- `--out results.xlsx`: per-magnet reverse fields.

The required iHc only covers the finished array. Handling during assembly can be worse: two ½" cubes forced together face-to-face in repulsion see up to ~930 kA/m near their edges.

## Compact magnet design study (this fork)

See [DESIGN_NOTES.md](DESIGN_NOTES.md) for the 100 mm bore / 40 x 40 mm region design built from 1/4" N42 cubes, the tools
added for it (`optimize_robust_aligned.py`, `refine_minimax.py`, as-built tolerance analysis), the ring-holder CAD generator (`make_ring_cad.py`,
`make_test_coupon.py`, `check_bolt_loads.py`), and what was learned.
